		<p>I was asked to design and code a theme for 4ormat's homegrown CMS, which allowed users to insert a wide variety of content and change the appearance of the theme. My designs had to predict and accommodate these changes.</p>

<p>I worked with the 4ormat creative director to design a new theme for their CMS. At the same time, I learned and used 4ormat's template language to create a valid template that inserts variables directly into the CSS, allowing users to change the theme's appearance.</p>
