If you're interested in <strong class="highlighted">freelance work</strong> and have something small or well-defined, let's chat. Please be aware that I already have a handful of freelance clients, personal projects, and my day job.

If you're looking to fill a <strong class="highlighted">full time or contract gig</strong>, please know that I'm happily employed as a web designer and front-end developer in northern New Jersey and am not on the market. Of course, things change, so I keep this page well updated.

If you want to ask a question, talk shop, or just say hi, drop me an email. I promise I'll reply as soon as my son lets me.
