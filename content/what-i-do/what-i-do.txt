Text:
I'm a design generalist best suited in teams where everyone can wear multiple hats. I'm highly adaptable, work directly with clients, and can manage projects. My long term goal is to be a designer-manager hybrid, splitting time between hands-on work and managing / mentoring a small team.

From scoping requirements to planning content &ndash; through design and development &ndash; collaboration between myself and clients is paramount. I prefer working with clients and sharing regular updates rather than disappearing for weeks and emerging with big surprises.
