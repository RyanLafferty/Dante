Description: What I do, what I enjoy most, and what I'd like to be doing in the future.

Text: I'm a design generalist best suited in teams where everyone can wear multiple hats. I'm highly adaptable, work directly with clients, and can manage projects. My long term goal is to be a designer-manager hybrid, splitting time between hands-on work and managing / mentoring a small team.
