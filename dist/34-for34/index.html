Most people aren’t good at this, whether they admit it or not.</li><li>“I think we’re overthinking this” is usually safe to say in a meeting.</li><li>Learning to say “not yet” is just as important as learning to say “no”.</li><li>There is a difference between taking offense and standing up for what you believe.</li><li>Trends are for suckers.</li><li>Retry things you don’t like every once in awhile.</li><li>If a cow ever got the chance, it would eat you and everyone you care about.</li><li>When we say we “don’t know what to do,” the majority of time we actually do know what to do, we just don’t like the answer.</li><li>Atheist or evangelical, the more you talk about how others should live, the less anyone will listen to you.</li><li>Debates over terminology and semantics are for academics and lawyers. If you’re interested in making a difference, focus on building things rather than talking about them.</li><li>To seek real answers to life’s big questions, you have to explore space. Saying “I don’t care, I’m not going to look out beyond the horizon” is... not good.</li><li>Everybody loves science until it debunks their personal bullshit belief.</li><li>You are entitled to your own opinion, but not your own facts.</li><li>But the problem with “I’m entitled to my opinion” is that it’s used to shelter beliefs that should have been abandoned.</li><li>When creating a website, don’t use 1and1.com for anything. At all. Ever.</li><li>Find someone who will tell you what sucks about your work.

I’m ok with that.</li><li>Periodically go back and read everything you’ve posted this year on Facebook, Twitter, etc. This is essentially documentation, and it’s how some people see you. It’s ok to delete things.</li><li>There are few things better than a quiet moment with your wife.</li><li>Always consider the possibility that everyone you love could die tomorrow. Tell your family how much you love them.</li><li>If you were to drop off the face of the earth tomorrow, the people who call looking for you are your real friends.</li><li>When I got married and had a kid, my own death stopped mattering as long they’re ok.</li><li>Don’t complain. Somebody always has it worse. A lot worse.</li><li>Fear is a compass pointing true north.
