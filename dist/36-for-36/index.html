Where the hell did that come from? So yea, I did one of those birthday posts. I did it <a href="/blog/34-for34/">two years ago</a> too. But <abbr title="For F*ck’s Sake">ffs</abbr> this is not one of those life-lessons posts; I’m not telling any body else how to live, I have enough trouble controlling my own body. This is more like a note to myself. Because I read my own blog. Because I’m cool like that.</p><p>Above photo is modified from <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/1056111/Make-Something-365">Aled Lewis’s brilliant series</a>. The list below paraphrases from other people too.</p><ol><li>Have strong opinions, but hold them weakly.</li><li>Things in life are rarely as risky as they seem. Don’t worry so much.</li><li>Ask for what you want.</li><li>Forgive people.</li><li>Sports are cool and dumb.</li><li>Money is circulated. Time is spent. So it goes.</li><li>Coffee is a warm, tasty alternative to hating everything every morning forever.</li><li>Learn to code. Or literally anything else.</li><li>Being a good writer is 3% talent and 97% not being distracted by the Internet.</li><li>You can punch back.</li><li>Clubs &lt; bars &lt; restaurants &lt; someone’s backyard where you don’t have to shout to talk.</li><li>Think for a few seconds before you act. Think for a few minutes if you’re angry.</li><li>Don’t judge other people too quickly. You never know their whole story.</li><li>Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it’s time to pause and reflect.</li><li>Surround yourself with people who like the same pizza toppings as you.</li><li>Experience may be fine but testing is better. Knowing something will work never takes the place of proving it will.</li><li>Only read about half way through dumb lists like this because you obviously get the point by now.</li><li>We all have something that someone else would kill for.</li><li>Background App Refresh is a battery killer. Turn it off, you won’t miss it.</li><li>When you only use the screen for mindless distraction and entertainment, then the result is a distracted mind in need of entertainment.</li><li>Social media needs verbs other than “Like” and “Favorite.”</li><li>No one looks back on their lives and remembers the nights they got plenty of sleep.</li><li>Ideas are worthless until you get them out of your head and see what they can do. WORTHLESS.</li><li>One benefit of working hard is that good opportunities will come along, but it’s still up to you to jump on them when they do.</li><li>Everybody is trying. They just don’t think exactly like you do. Be empathetic.</li><li>Clearly labeling other people’s petty grievances as bullshit leads to well-being and fewer complaints of your own.</li><li>Data has never convinced anyone who didn’t want to be convinced. Some debates are simply a waste of time.</li><li>Don’t drink with anyone who refers to their favorite sports team as “us.”</li><li>Who you are has more to do with how you act than what you say.</li><li>There are incredibly smart people doing incredibly good things who aren’t good at promoting what they’re doing.</li><li>Fear is still a compass pointing true north.</li><li>I can give you all the advice in the world, but in the end you’ll be judged by your profile picture.</li><li>I’m done with this stupid list. Learn to quit whenever you feel like it.</li></ol></div></article></main><footer class="py-6"><p class="text-xs tc-light">Design and code (except graphics) are open source on <a href="https://github.com/TedGoas/Dante">GitHub</a>.
