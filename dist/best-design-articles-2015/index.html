I particularly enjoyed the section **Your org chart is not your information architecture** since it’s rarely how folks outside an organization think. Also true in the private sector.<hr role="presentation" aria-role="hidden" class="hr hr-lg"><h2><a href="https://medium.com/user-research/never-ask-what-they-want-3-better-questions-to-ask-in-user-interviews-aeddd2a2101e#.nbi1t1263">Never Ask What They Want</a></h2>> “If you jump to asking users about how they think something can be better from the start, you only get their opinion, not how they actually deal with their current problem.”<p>Users are best at explaining their goals and workflow tendencies. Don’t just build whatever people say they want.</p><hr role="presentation" aria-role="hidden" class="hr hr-lg"><figure><img src="/images/blog/best-of-2015/imgur.png" alt="Imgur logo." width="750" height="300"></figure><h2><a href="https://medium.com/@gerstenzang/16-product-things-i-learned-at-imgur-4e58b936759c#.nb4cnfobc">16 product things I learned at Imgur</a></h2>I did not expect this level of mature product thinking from a site about GIFs.

This article talks about what to look for when watching the competition. Complete with Mario Kart reference!<hr role="presentation" aria-role="hidden" class="hr hr-lg"><figure><img src="/images/blog/best-of-2015/amazon.png" alt="A lot of Amazon tabs." width="750" height="300"></figure><h2><a href="http://andrewchen.co/product-design-debt-versus-technical-debt/">Product Design Debt Versus Technical Debt</a></h2>At a certain point, a design might stop catering to new features being piled on. This year, a few of my designs reached this point. Articles like this helped me realize when it’s time to modify or consolidate a design in the face of new content. > “Each incremental menu item is not a big deal, and provides a lot of value downstream, but a slight incremental cost. But do this enough times, and you’ll start to pollute the overall design aesthetic, which is a public good that all features share.”<hr role="presentation" aria-role="hidden" class="hr hr-lg"><figure><img src="/images/blog/best-of-2015/roadmap.png" alt="Example of Product Roadmap." width="750" height="300"></figure><h2><a href="https://blog.intercom.io/before-you-plan-your-product-roadmap/">Before You Plan Your Next Product Roadmap</a></h2>> “Are all your users using all the features in your product? Of course they’re not. Let’s talk about that.”<p>Project roadmaps don’t just involve building new things. Intercom offers advice on auditing parts of a project, picking out things that folks don’t use much, and reconsidering their utility.</p><hr role="presentation" aria-role="hidden" class="hr hr-lg"><figure><img src="/images/blog/best-of-2015/waterbed.jpg" alt="Two porcupines discussing a how a waterbed was a bad idea." width="750" height="300"></figure><h2><a href="https://medium.com/first-round-insiders/the-high-price-of-the-wrong-solution-609e706d3b0#.3hy1g495u">The High Price of the Wrong Solution</a></h2>> “Here were founders who had defined a real, tangible problem. But their solution went after it piecemeal. Every time they discovered something new — a different facet to the problem, a different audience — they added a new feature to address it. The result is what felt like a very complex, brittle product that will never fully solve the problem.”<p>Sound familiar? It does to me. A nice, short read on product design definition.</p><hr role="presentation" aria-role="hidden" class="hr hr-lg"><figure><img src="/images/blog/best-of-2015/active-collab.jpg" alt="Preview of Acive Collab redesign." width="750" height="300"></figure><h2><a href="https://blog.activecollab.com/redesigning-active-collab-393608cb019b#.r07aucg0j">Redesigning Active Collab</a></h2>Along same lines as the above, this case study details how designers reduced and streamlined a product that had lost its way. I thoroughly enjoyed the section titled The problem of too much functionality. > “It’s much easier to add features and create an illusion that the software is powerful than to actually invest effort, understand the needs of real users, and develop the product accordingly.”<hr role="presentation" aria-role="hidden" class="hr hr-lg"><figure><img src="/images/blog/best-of-2015/wired.jpg" alt="Beautiful products.

Although most every product or site is usable, I’m often nagged by the feeling that I hadn’t given it my all.

To them, I am a threat.
