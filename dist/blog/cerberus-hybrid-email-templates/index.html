The big difference is that now there is a hybrid template that works on mobile without media queries.</p><hr role="presentation" aria-role="hidden" class="hr-sm"><p>Iâ€™ve been writing HTML emails for a while. Iâ€™d become comfortable making responsive websites using media queries, so it seemed like a natural fit for emails. I constructed a simple set of responsive email patterns based on responsive breakpoints and called it Cerberus. I could quickly construct emails desktop and responsive emails very quickly. The majority of my email lists primarily use iOS Mail, which supports media queries. I thought I had struck a good balance. Things were going great.</p><p>Iâ€™ve heard of hybrid email design as a way to enforce responsive email layouts in email clients that donâ€™t support media queries (like Gmail). It seemed like a good idea, but it required a significant amount of extra work and anyway, email isnâ€™t the main function of my job. Clients werenâ€™t asking for it. So I procrastinated learning hybrid design.</p><figure><img src="/images/blog/cerberus/no-media-queries.jpg" alt="No media queries allowed. Cartoon." width="210" height="198"></figure><p>While I procrastinated, I watched Gmail usage grow in my lists. I also noticed a number of new mobile email clients popping up, many of which donâ€™t support media queries. I realized the relying on media query support wasnâ€™t going to scale. It was time to invest in hybrid design.</p><p>I went to <a href="https://litmus.com/conference">The Email Design Conference</a> in Boston with the goal of learning a practical way to code hybrid emails. By attending Fabio Carneiroâ€™s talk and <a href="https://github.com/fcarneiro/tedc15_template">studying his code</a>, I finally wrapped my head around the concept. Iâ€™ve also learned quite a bit from the <a href="http://labs.actionrocket.co/the-hybrid-coding-approach">Action Rocket folks</a>.</p><p>The hybrid template reflects what Iâ€™ve learned so far. Itâ€™s a start, and something I look forward to improving as I go. Itâ€™s open source, obviously, so I encourage you to help reduce the entropy of the code.</p><p>And wouldnâ€™t you know it, about a month after the conference, a client asked me if I could design a responsive email that looked good in Gmail.</p></div></article></main><footer class="py-6"><p class="text-xs tc-light">Design and code (except graphics) are open source on <a href="https://github.com/TedGoas/Dante">GitHub</a>.
