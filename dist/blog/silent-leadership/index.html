I love design+code and want to keep improving, but don‚Äôt know what the next step in my career should be.</p><p>In tech, advancing one‚Äôs career doesn't have to mean following a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù path of giving up one‚Äôs craft and moving into management. It‚Äôs perfectly acceptable to focus on improving the work itself and developing a solid design career as an individual contributor (IC for short). But at the same time, I can‚Äôt help but notice how some folks I‚Äôve known for a while have transitioned from IC roles to managerial roles. I ask myself:</p><ul><li>How did they end up in that role?</li><li>Did they work towards it? Or did it happen circumstantially?</li><li>Is the natural path to become a manager?</li><li>Is that what I should strive for?</li></ul><p>As I try to decide what job title I should be working towards, I‚Äôve talked with a number of designers and design managers about their career paths. I began to notice a theme start to emerge.</p><h2>Silent Leadership</h2><blockquote><p>If you‚Äôre looking to grow as a leader, don‚Äôt wait for someone to promote you into that position. Uncover the areas where you can lead and just start doing it.</p></blockquote><p>I first heard the term ‚ÄúSilent Leadership‚Äù from <a href="https://twitter.com/flcarneiro">Fabio Carneiro</a> in a Slack conversation. The idea is to show that you have some of the requisite skills of a leader without having the title. Act as a unifier by facilitating communication between people, for example. Or act as an ad hoc project manager by taking care of the all the ancillary stuff around projects to allow others to focus on designing. Become the person who people come to for advice, or to vent. Run the meetings when the creative director is out sick. Push the team to explore other design solutions when they‚Äôve tunneled in on only one. Pull the person who got yelled at in the meeting aside and explain why it happened. Mentor the new hire. Be an ambassador for non-designers. Become a subject matter expert through writing or giving talks (be it at a conference or within your team). Put the term ‚Äúthought leader‚Äù in your bio. Ok, maybe not that last one.</p><p>The idea is to focus on more than just design. Don‚Äôt just be a good designer, be a good co-worker and professional. <a href="https://medium.com/leading-design/7-problems-growing-design-teams-face-5fd94292d405#.ypjlirc33">You don‚Äôt earn a leadership position with your headphones on</a>. If you‚Äôre already doing the job of a design leader, it‚Äôs your best way in.</p><figure><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Want to be well-known in your industry? Help as many people as you can.<br><br>Having a good reputation opens all kinds of doors.</p>&mdash; Justin Jackson (@mijustin) <a href="https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/835922584684285952">February 26, 2017</a></blockquote><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><figcaption>Applicable here and elsewhere</figcaption></figure><h2>Work for a Company that Looks for Silent Leadership</h2><p>But doing this is only part of the battle. You also have to be working for a company that has its eyes open for silent leadership. Cap Watkins talked about how Buzzfeed thinks about the career path of its designers at <a href="https://www.asburyagile.com/schedule.html">Asbury Agile 2016</a> (graphic below). <a href="https://open.buffer.com/career-framework/">Buffer</a>, <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/making-a-career.md">Basecamp</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/facebook-design/tips-for-becoming-a-design-leader-7f32513b4c3f">Facebook</a> have all written about career advancement options for their staff. They all include career paths that don‚Äôt involve management.</p><figure><img src="/images/blog/silent-leadership/cap-watkins.png" alt="Cap Watkins at Asbury Agile 2016, Diagram." height="450" width="600"><figcaption class="mt3">At BuzzFeed, IC and manager tracks are parallel, not sequential. Eg. moving from a Sr. Product Designer to a Creative direction is a lateral move rather than a promotion.</figcaption></figure><p>I particularly like how Buffer explains its framework:</p><blockquote><p>All of our frameworks focus on two things:</p><ul><li>The scope of influence that a person has on their work, their team, the company, and the industry</li><li>The ownership that they have over their area</li></ul></blockquote><p>This shows a clear path of advancement without needing direct reports in the org chart.</p><p>Not all companies recognize and reward silent leadership, though. My last employer didn‚Äôt and I eventually resigned because of it.</p><h2>Making a Career</h2><p>When I joined Stack Overflow as a senior product designer, one of the things I immediately appreciated was how the company emphasizes career development and personal growth. At Stack Overflow, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/company/salary/skills/product-designer?e=1&amp;l=1">designers don‚Äôt just design</a>. Strong leadership from individual contributors plays a big role in steering product development at the company.</p><p>I‚Äôm not quite ready to take over my boss‚Äôs job and detach myself from design work entirely, but I do take every opportunity to develop my silent leadership skills. That way, when I finally figure out what I want to do with my life, I should have a few good options.</p><p>Do you have similar thoughts? At a crossroads in your career?
