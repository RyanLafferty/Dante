A few months ago, I created a fairly in-depth responsive email template containing what I thought was a number of common email patterns. Everything worked in popular email clients, even in Outlook. <a href="https://github.com/TedGoas/Responsive-Email-XX">I put it on GitHub</a>. Some people starred / forked / talked about it. I was happy: I made progress towards my goal.</p><p>But after a while, I noticed that I had stopped using it. I found the template so complicated that I sometimes had to relearn parts of it. And if <em>I</em> was having trouble understanding it, I worried about how others were fairing.</p><p><strong>Big problem.</strong></p><p>In hindsight, I packed way too much into a single template. It became hard to follow how the HTML and CSS matched up. And I only used about half of the layout patterns in production emails. Why did I include so much? No good reason.</p><p>So I fixed it.</p><p>You may be thinking, ‚ÄúOh wonderful... another responsive email template.‚Äù Yep, I thought about that too. 2013 seemed to be the year of email. Responsive emails took off when <a href="http://zurb.com/playground/responsive-email-templates">Zurb</a> and <a href="https://github.com/InterNations/antwort">InterNations</a> showed it was possible. Lots of folks joined the movement, improving both the code quality and process. <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/">Campaign Monitor</a>, <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a>, and <a href="https://litmus.com/">Litmus</a> all rolled out huge updates and new tools. <a href="http://modernhtmlemail.com/">Books were written</a>. Blogs were started. <a href="http://emailmarketingreactions.tumblr.com/">GIFs were Tumbled</a>. Email even got its <a href="https://litmus.com/conference">first ever conference</a>.</p><p>Looking at everything that happened in 2013, I saw a focus on prebuilt templates and design tools like CSS inliners, code previews, template builders. Aside from Brian Grave‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/briangraves/ResponsiveEmailPatterns">responsive email patterns</a>, I didn‚Äôt see many resources dedicated to folks who kinda already know what they‚Äôre doing<sup>1</sup> and code from scratch by hand.</p><p>But that‚Äôs how I work and I wanted to make something that‚Äôd help folks like me.</p><p>So I removed the stuff I never used from my first email and refactored the rest. I compartmentalized the pattern blocks so that they may be mixed and matched to build an email. Everything has good email client support, including Outlook, Android, and even mobile Gmail.</p><p>So that‚Äôs it. A small number of responsive email patterns that, when combined, go a long way.</p><p>A mantra of email design is: keep the layout simple. Where my first attempt failed, I hope this one succeeds.</p><p>So if you like doing things by hand and want a few solid code blocks to start with, check out <a href="http://tedgoas.github.io/Cerberus/">Cerberus</a><sup>2</sup> on GitHub. It‚Äôs what I use to start every HTML email I create.</p><p><a href="http://tedgoas.github.io/Cerberus/">View on Github</a></p><p><sup>1</sup> - Well, not 100% true. Everyone mentioned in this article helps seasoned email designers, whether it‚Äôs studying code on GitHub or reading about email tricks and gotchas on blogs / Twitter.</p><p><sup>2</sup> - Between desktop, mobile, and Outlook, HTML email is a three-headed dog from hell.</p></div></article></div></main><footer class="site-footer hd-border-right"><p class="p-6 text-xs tc-light hd-border-top">Design and code (except graphics) are open source on <a href="https://github.com/TedGoas/Dante" class="mono">GitHub</a>.
