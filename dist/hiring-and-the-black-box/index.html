The idea is based on the concept of talking the talk versus walking the walk. I like the idea, but online presence alone can‚Äôt drive the hiring process for my company.</p><h2>Small Ponds</h2><p>We‚Äôve been interviewing developers and engineers at my day job. We‚Äôre located in suburban New Jersey. Not exactly a technology hub. Not even a city. And mostly because of <abbr title="U.S. Food and Drug Administration">FDA</abbr> regulations, we require our employees to work on-site. So unfortunately we can‚Äôt hire the best person we find regardless of geographic location. We have to pick from folks within a commutable radius.</p><p>Despite the progressive nature of my company‚Äôs work, our hiring process is fairly traditional. When we have an opening in my group, we solicit resumes. Based on the collection of Word documents we receive, we call in a few candidates.</p><p>When we interview for a technical position, my team follows a loose script. The candidate‚Äôs technical chops are tested by our developers. There‚Äôs a code review and usually a role play towards the end.</p><p>Somewhere in there, it‚Äôs my job to evaluate each candidate‚Äôs character. See how they think. Find out what they care about. What they currently learning or excited to try. I ask about what they‚Äôve read. If they‚Äôre on Twitter, Github, or CodePen. Brownie points if they‚Äôve heard of Dribbble or Behance.</p><h2>The Black Box</h2><p>As a responsible interviewer, I do my research before meeting each candidate. I don‚Äôt expect everyone who walks into our lobby to have hundreds of followers and a stable of side projects, but I expect every candidate who builds for the web to be online in some way.</p><p>I‚Äôm usually on Google before I finish reading each resume. I look for the kind of work candidates put out and what they say online. This all helps me predict how they might fit in with our team.</p><p>During my Internet sleuthing, I‚Äôm astounded by how often I find nothing. No Twitter, no GitHub, not even a personal website. I worry about hiring someone with no portfolio, no online presence, and no referral to build web tools for our company. My team has to make a decision based on the information we have, and often we have very little.</p><p>Candidates like this are essentially a black box. The only way to tell what‚Äôs inside is to hire them and see how the first few weeks play out. Sounds like a gamble, but my company is often forced to hire folks like this.</p><h2>Web Gems</h2><p>You may not believe this, but I‚Äôm usually pleasantly surprised. One developer came on with little JavaScript experience and learned jQuery top to bottom inside six months. Another came in and moved most of our markup-based charts into Rapha√´l effortlessly. Our mobile developer, who came on having only developed for Android, now has four iOS apps under his belt. Ironically, the last developer we hired who was on GitHub and knew about Dribbble lasted eight days.</p><p>Don‚Äôt be so quick to write off these ‚Äúblack box‚Äù candidates. There are diamonds in the rough out there. More than you‚Äôd think. Anyone who prefers online activity to resumes might just miss out on these folks.</p></article></main><footer class="site-width py-6 hd-border-top"><p class="text-xs tc-light">Design and code (except graphics) are open source on <a href="https://github.com/TedGoas/Dante">GitHub</a>.
