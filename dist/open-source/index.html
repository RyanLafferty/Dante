Contributing to others‚Äô projects is also important, but I won‚Äôt cover that here.</li><li>Open source projects can lead to pleasant surprises. I‚Äôve used mine as leverage to get pay raises and at least one speaking gig.</li></ul><p>I‚Äôm a designer. In 2013 I created <a href="http://tedgoas.github.io/Cerberus/">Cerberus</a>, a set of simple HTML email templates that solve a lot of common gotchas in getting emails to display properly across email clients. I have a few open source projects, but Cerberus is my main jam. It‚Äôs been used by <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2839730-A-Litmus-Love-Story">the team at dribbble</a>, and is included in products like Dreamweaver and <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2839730-A-Litmus-Love-Story">Litmus Builder</a>.</p><p>In this article, I‚Äôd like to share a few tips that guide my open source work and show a few examples of some awesome open source projects.</p><h2>1. Choose Something Timeless and Stick With It</h2><p>There‚Äôs a saying that certain jobs are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession-proof_job">recession-proof</a>. I‚Äôm not suggesting every open source project should survive the nuclear apocalypse, but there are certainly parallels. A project should be something that can evolve through paradigm shifts. Something trendy like a long-shadow generator is probably not a good bet, but so many projects end up needing <a href="https://inclusive-components.design/tooltips-toggletips/">a good tooltip</a> at some point.</p><p>For me, email is an obvious choice. Email is mature, ubiquitous, and has proven staying power‚Ä¶ no matter how many people proclaim that email is dead. When I started Cerberus, I worked on it slowly and steadily for a few years before anyone started noticing it. And that‚Äôs ok, because email‚Äôs gonna be around for a while.</p><h2>2. Make It Small and Focused</h2><p>I have a full-time job, a young family, own a house, and enjoy life away from screens. I mostly work on my project alone, so it‚Äôs important not to spread myself too thin. I resist building bells and whistles; they‚Äôre more to maintain. I minimize dependencies; they‚Äôre roadblocks for folks getting started. I‚Äôve left the design open for folks to adapt it for their own needs.</p><blockquote><p>Cerberus is a few simple, but solid patterns for responsive HTML emails.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://tedgoas.github.io/Cerberus/">That‚Äôs what‚Äôs on the tin</a>. Cerberus‚Äôs design is grayscale, uses placeholder images, and contains dummy text. It doesn‚Äôt even define a font. It‚Äôs intentionally simple and unassuming. It does just a few things but it does them really well. Well, that‚Äôs the goal anyway.</p><figure><img src="/images/blog/open-source/cerberus-preview.png" alt="Screenshot of Cerberus's design." height="488" width="890"><figcaption>Cerberus (in all it‚Äôs beauty)</figcaption></figure><p>When considering new features, I think about 37Signals‚Äôs ‚Äú<a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Start_With_No.php">Start with No‚Äù</a> in Getting Real. A while back, I was asked to extend Cerberus‚Äôs three-column layout to support four columns.</p><blockquote><p>GitHub-User: Hi, can you please make a four column layout? Me: Hmm, that‚Äôs possible. Can you tell me a little about what you need it for? ‚Ä¶</p></blockquote><p>I got no response. Building a four column layout was totally possible, but I never built it because it wasn‚Äôt important enough to this person. No one‚Äôs asked for it since.</p><figure class="outset"><img src="/images/blog/open-source/fight-club.jpg" alt="Waiting on the porch in the movie Fight Club." height="532" width="1280"></figure><p>It‚Äôs like Fight Club. You should only consider features if they‚Äôre willing to stand on the porch for three days waiting to be let in.</p><h2>3. Dogfood It</h2><p>This might go without saying, but using my own project helps me understand how it can be used so common workflows can be optimized. Email has been part of nearly every project I‚Äôve worked on in the past few years, so I reach for Cerberus quite often.</p><p>Dogfooding it helps‚Ä¶</p><ul><li>find and fix bugs in dark corners</li><li>write documentation</li><li>educate and offer tips on how best to adapt and extend the project</li></ul><h2>4. Work on Non-Visible Features</h2><p>I designed for a healthcare company for six years. Our work was heavily regulated (HIPAA) and we had strict privacy and security protocols. Every so often, I‚Äôd search for a plugin or tool to solve a problem. I usually found something that did the trick, but it would violate U.S. healthcare regulations.</p><blockquote><p>Well $@*#‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt use this one!</p></blockquote><p>I had a lot of these moments. It was very frustrating.</p><p>But it made me appreciate things like accessibility, download speed, industry-specific compliance (higher education, healthcare, government, etc.), and browser / device support. I don‚Äôt want to knowingly exclude folks from being able to use my project.</p><figure><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The world doesn&#39;t need new and innovative interaction patterns as much as designers believe. It just needs shit to work.</p>&mdash; Cemre G√ºng√∂r (@gem_ray) <a href="https://twitter.com/gem_ray/status/481855135610847233">June 25, 2014</a></blockquote><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><figcaption>Too often in tech, ‚Äúshit doesn‚Äôt just work.‚Äù</figcaption></figure><h2>5. Double-Down on Documentation</h2><p>As amazingly self-documenting as I think my project is‚Ä¶ yea, it‚Äôs really not. Prioritizing documentation makes a project more approachable and understandable. I try to remind myself that no one is in my brain but me (I hope). All those decisions I made in my head may as well not even exist to anyone else unless they‚Äôre documented somewhere.</p><ul><li>A decent <a href="https://github.com/LappleApple/feedmereadmes/blob/master/README-maturity-model.md">readme file</a> helps people get up and running.</li><li>Documentation helps explain why things work the way they do.</li><li>Code comments are good for for granular things.</li><li>Good commit messages explain what changed, when, and why.</li><li>Thoughtful discussions in GitHub issues and pull requests explain what ideas were considered and why they were implemented (or not implemented).</li><li>Demos help visualize results.</li></ul><figure class="outset"><img src="/images/blog/open-source/cerberus-code.png" alt="Screenshot of Cerberus's code comments." height="810" width="1278"><figcaption>Screenshot of Cerberus‚Äôs code; the dark gray text is code comments.</figcaption></figure><h2>6. Include Instructions on How to Contribute</h2><p>As my project matured, it started to get a little attention. As folks started using it, they had ideas on how to fix stuff or add to the project. This is a great thing, though I hit a few stumbling blocks in the beginning because I didn‚Äôt specify any contribution guidelines. So I‚Äôd occasionally get messages like this:</p><blockquote><p>GitHub-User: Hey, I found and fixed a bug in a template. Here‚Äôs a pull request! Me: Thank you very much! Hey, Cerberus is actually three templates, would you mind fixing the other two?</p></blockquote><p>People didn‚Äôt know how to help because I didn‚Äôt tell them. face-palm-dot-gif</p><p>I created <a href="http://tedgoas.github.io/Cerberus/#contribute">some contribution guidelines</a> in the project‚Äôs docs to help steer the project in the direction I wanted to see it go and direct help where it‚Äôs needed most. So I don‚Äôt get a pull request out of nowhere with some changes I don‚Äôt want.</p><hr role="presentation" aria-role="hidden" class="hr"><h2>Examples!!</h2><p>Alright, enough advice. Here are a few simple, focused, and well-documented open source projects I keep coming back to.</p><h3><a href="https://backgrounds.cm/">Bulletproof Background Images in Email</a></h3><p>Getting background images to display in email clients takes a lot of code that I‚Äôll never memorize. This project provides a few options and spits out working code that can be pasted into any email template. It does this <em>one</em> thing <em>really</em> well.</p><figure><img src="/images/blog/open-source/bulletproof-background-images-email.png" alt="Background.cm web interface." height="890" width="1488"><figcaption>Backgrounds.cm by Campaign Monitor</figcaption></figure><h3><a href="https://yeun.github.io/open-color/">Open Color</a></h3><p>This project researched a color palette optimized for interfaces. It‚Äôs been tested for things like accessibility, brightness, and contrast across a range of different screens. The whole project is colors. That‚Äôs all it is. Brilliant.</p><figure><img src="/images/blog/open-source/open-color.png" alt="Open Color GitHub repo." height="890" width="1488"><figcaption>Open Color by heeyeun</figcaption></figure><h3><a href="https://github.com/phanan/htaccess">.htaccess Snippets</a></h3><p>I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd ever edited an .htaccess without bringing an entire site down‚Ä¶ until I found this project. The entire project is the readme.md file, which contains paste-able snippets of common .htaccess commands. I‚Äôll reference this until the day we hire an .htaccess programmer üòÜ.</p><figure><img src="/images/blog/open-source/htaccess-snippets.png" alt=".htaccess snippets GitHub repo." height="890" width="1488"><figcaption>.htaccess snippets by Phan An</figcaption></figure><h3><a href="https://gist.github.com/malarkey/4031110">Contract Killer</a></h3><p>Contract Killer is a popular open source contract for web professionals that translates confusing legal passages into layman‚Äôs terms. The entire project is a text document in a GitHub Gist. A contract is part of any freelance project I take on, so I‚Äôve adapted my own version that I use each time.</p><figure><img src="/images/blog/open-source/contract-killer.png" alt="Contract Killer GitHub Gist." height="890" width="1488"><figcaption>Contract Killer by Andy Clarke</figcaption></figure><hr role="presentation" aria-role="hidden" class="hr"><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>I‚Äôm so happy you made it this far!
