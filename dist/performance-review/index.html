While the feedback was positive overall, no review is complete without citing areas to improve. After I combined the goals of my managers with my own, my plan for the year looked something like this:</p><h2>Less Twitter</h2><p>I treat Twitter mostly like an RSS feed. I was usually on it intermittently throughout the day and often found myself reading more than making. Now I rely more on things like <a href="http://sidebar.io">Sidebar.io</a> to summarize things. Instapaper helps too.</p><h2>More Writing</h2><p>In the spirit of that, Iâ€™ll be doing less tweeting myself. Iâ€™ll still interesting links and chat with friends, but instead of tweeting a bunch of half-baked ideas, Iâ€™d like to make a few of them into thoughtful articles.</p><h2>Less Dribbble</h2><p>Since 2010, Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time on dribbble. Being around talented designers had paid off in spades. But when I see things like <a href="http://dribbble.com/search?q=workspace">this</a> or <a href="http://dribbble.com/search?q=blur+background">this</a>, I grinds my gears. <a href="http://blog.keenancummings.com/post/42506303821/sweet-textures-bro" title="Sweet textures bro">Keenan Cummings summarizes my viewpoint well</a>. We tend to stay in our own little worlds, high-fiving each other and patting each other on the backs.</p><p>Dribbble is still part of my work week, but its focus is more narrow.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>2012 @<a href="https://twitter.com/dribbble">dribbble</a>: The year of the isometric DSLR shot of an iPhone running an app that doesn't work.</p>&mdash; Kyle Neath (@kneath) <a href="https://twitter.com/kneath/status/285794915890384896">December 31, 2012</a></blockquote><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><h2>Focus on a Visual Style</h2><p>When it comes to aesthetics, I tend to explore a little too often. Exploration is good, but I plan on devoting more time a single direction. I started creating a collection of common interface componests in HTML &amp; CSS. If it ever matures, Iâ€™ll put it on GitHub.</p><h2>More GitHub</h2><p>Iâ€™d like to contribute more on GitHub, on friendâ€™s projects and my own. Graphical freebies are nice, but theyâ€™re only art. Working code is better.</p><h2>House Cleaning</h2><p>Iâ€™ll be going through my Dribbble and Twitter follow lists to find folks treat these sites like more I do: Quality over quantity, reasonable signal vs. noise ratio, mature online etiquette.</p><h2>Be a Better Employee</h2><p>Last year I spent a lot of time becoming a better web builder. It worked. Itâ€™s time to focus more on things like project management, team management, presenting, and mentoring within my group here at work.</p><h2>My Family Is Not My Side Project</h2><p>Lastly, I donâ€™t want an unhealthy blur between work life and family life. When Iâ€™m home, Iâ€™m home. If my son if awake, Iâ€™m not in front of the computer. If my wife is around, my phone is in my pocket. <a href="http://chrisbowler.com/journal/overcoming-project-guilt" title="Overcoming Project Guilt">My family is not my side project</a>. I have hobbies that don't involve an Internet connection.</p></article></main><footer class="site-width py-6 hd-border-top"><p class="text-xs tc-light">Design and code (except graphics) are open source on <a href="https://github.com/TedGoas/Dante">GitHub</a>.
