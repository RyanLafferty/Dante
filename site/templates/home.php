	<h1 class="home-intro--title">I'm a reliable designer &amp; front-end developer working on websites, web apps, and HTML emails. I design things to be understandable, credible, easy to navigate, and fast.</h1>
	<p>I'm trying to create work that is cool enough to show my friends and honest enough to show my parents.</p>
	<p>When I'm not working on the web, I enjoy spending time with my wife and son, live music, snowboarding, hockey, soccer, Newcastle Ale, and quoting Troy McClure.</p>
