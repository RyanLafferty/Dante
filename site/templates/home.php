	<h1 class="home-intro--title">I'm a reliable designer &amp; front-end developer working on websites, web apps, and HTML emails.</h1>
	<p class="home-intro-p">I design things to be more understandable, credible and valuable. My goal is to create work that is cool enough to show my friends and honest enough to show my parents.</p>
	<p class="home-intro-p">When I'm not working on the web, I enjoy spending time with my wife and kids, live music, snowboarding, hockey, soccer, Newcastle Ale, and Troy McClure quotes.</p>
