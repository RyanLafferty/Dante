	<h1 class="home-intro--title">I’m a reliable designer and front-end developer who makes websites, applications, and HTML emails.</h1>
	<p class="home-intro-p">I believe design is about taking the complex and chaotic and making it accessible to people, so I design things to be understandable, readable, responsive, and as fast as possible. Since 2001, I’ve been trying to create work that is cool enough to show my friends and honest enough to show my parents.</p>
	<p class="home-intro-p">When I'm not working, I enjoy family time with my wife and kids, live music, snowboarding, hockey, soccer, Newcastle Ale, and Troy McClure quotes.</p>
