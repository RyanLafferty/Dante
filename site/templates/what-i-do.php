			<p>I'm a highly adaptable designer best suited in teams where everyone can wear multiple hats. From scoping requirements to planning content – through design and development – collaborating with clients and co-workers is paramount. I prefer designing with others and sharing regular updates rather than working in isolation for long stretches.</p>
			<p>For the past several years, I've become comfortable in a <strong>double diamond product development process</strong>. I enjoy working in all four stages.</p>

		<ul>
			<li class="mb4"><strong>Discover:</strong> Understand the current condition by auditing existing designs, reviewing competitors, interviewing users, “How Might We” brainstorming sessions, and gathering insights.</li>
			<li class="mb4"><strong>Define:</strong> Synthesize the possibilities identified in the discovery phase and focuses on the most compelling opportunities to pursue. Which matters most? Which should we act on first? What is feasible? The goal is to understand exactly what the project will and won't do, and what "success" will look like.</li>
			<li class="mb4"><strong>Develop:</strong> Explore the best potential solutions. Designs concepts are created, prototyped, tested, and iterated. This trial and error process helps ideas improve.</li>
			<li class="lh-md"><strong>Deliver:</strong> As confidence in the solution increases, exploration gives way to engineering. Working software is created, optimized, and shipped.</li>

		<h2>What I'm Working Towards</h2>
		<p>My goal is to be a <strong class="highlighted">designer-manager hybrid</strong>. I can already do everything mentioned above, but I’d also like to mentor or manage a small team, making sure they’re happy, inspired, and successfully delivering for their clients. I’m interested in facilitating critiques, discussing new processes, designing exercises, helping with sales leads, and any other problems whether code or people.</p>
