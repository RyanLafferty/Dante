	<p>The company website is personal to a lot people, and it's redesign brought out a lot of emotions. Stakeholders were proud, opinionated, worried, territorial. Everyone had the same goal for the site, but a different opinion on how to get there. It was my job to capture everyone’s vision and balance it with the needs of the business.</p>
	<p>I Was Asked to Lead, But Wasn't In Charge</p>
	<p>I regularly met with the heads of each department to understand their needs and worked directly with the company owner to mold these inputs into a portrait of the company. I led countless design reviews and demos, organized feedback, and prioritized resulting work.</p>

	<p>Many of Canfield’s products and services are specialized, and they don’t always fit into shared templates very well. I was challenged to design flexible templates that could share some design patterns while allowing for one-off, art-directed design when necessary.</p>
	<p>I developed a series of templates made up modular blocks that can be mixed and matched to create a product or service page.</p>
	<h2>Challenge: Navigating Conflict</h2>
	<p>This was a high profile project within the company and emotions ran high. I was in the middle of a few tense meetings. I focused on asking lots of questions, listening, and keeping my own biases from leading the design in the wrong direction.</p>
	<p>During the planning process, I asked each stakeholder what success looks like and noted their answer. We made small adjustments during the project, but having documented goals to reference avoided lots of churn. Ultimately each design we produced succeeded when it solved the problem, not because “everyone liked it.”</p>
	<h2>The Result</h2>
	<p>The redesign was met with overwhelming positivity. Clients approached us at conferences, commending the site’s way-finding systems and refreshed content. Internally, each area of the business is now accurately represented and stakeholders have more tools to maintain their area of the site.</p>
	<h2>What I Learned</h2>
	<p>Stakeholders were often skeptical, risk-averse, and viewed my ideas as a threat to “the way it’s always been done.” And this is totally understandable. I learned frame my suggestions as solutions to their problems and sell my designs.</p>
