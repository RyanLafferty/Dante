						<p>The company website is personal to a lot people, so it's redesign brought out a lot of emotions. Stakeholders were proud, opinionated, worried... territorial. Everyone had the same goal for the site, but a different opinion on how to get there. It was my job to capture everyone’s vision and balance it with the needs of the business.</p>

						<p>I regularly met with the heads of each department to understand their needs and worked directly with the company owner to mold these inputs into a portrait of the company. I led countless design reviews and presentations, organized feedback, and prioritized resulting work within the team.</p>

						<p>Many of Canfield’s products and services are specialized, and they don’t always fit into shared templates very well. I was challenged to design flexible templates that could share some content and code patterns, but allow for custom content as necessary.</p>

						<p>I worked with every department and over 100 employees. I learned what everyone’s day-to-day looks like. Who speaks directly with customers. How the billing process works. What support issues keep coming up. And what parts of the website each department depends on most. Learning this was immensely helpful in prioritizing work that had the highest impact on the business.</p>
