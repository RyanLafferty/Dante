	<p>Working at Canfield Scientific</p>
	<p>As Canfield’s only designer, I worked on websites, apps, email marketing, and iOS apps. My day-to-day involved a mix of research, sketching, Photoshop, coding, writing, and meetings. I helped guide project strategy, worked directly with our clients (both internal and external), and lead product demos and design critiques.</p>

	<p>Much of of time was spent designing apps for clinical trials and doctors offices. Before joining Canfield, everything I’d worked on was consumer based. While some things translate well, in other respects designing for medical is a completely different ballgame. I wrote about my experiences, the good and the bad.</p>

	<p>We didn’t have a formalized development process, so we often had major insights that required us to make large, sometimes destabilizing changes late in projects. Our milestones were usually tied to immovable dates like trade shows, so we were always prepared to ship a stable version of the product and watched closely as new clients onboarded.</p>

	<p>I was responsible for every email Canfield sent. We sent about marketing 20-25 emails a year, a mixture of promotional, loyalty, event, and digest emails. Our web products also send transactional emails for things like password reset and account confirmation. I work with stakeholders to design each email, code for all popular email clients (Litmus), and schedule deployment in our ESP or codebase, and track metrics.</p>
