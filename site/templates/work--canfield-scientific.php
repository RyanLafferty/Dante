						<p>The company website was personal to a lot people, so brought out a lot of emotions. Stakeholders were proud, opinionated, worried, territorial. Everyone had the same goal for the site, but a different opinion on how to get there.</p>

						<p>It was my job to capture everyone’s vision and balance it with the needs of the business. I regularly met with the heads of each department to understand their needs and worked directly with the company owner to mold these inputs into a portrait of the company. I led countless design reviews and presentations, organized feedback, and prioritized resulting work within the team. Iterate. Iterate. Iterate.</p>

						<p>This was a high profile project within the company and emotions ran high. I was in the middle of a few tense meetings. My focus was to ask lots of questions, listen, and keep my biases from leading the design in the wrong direction.</p>

						<p>During the planning process, I asked each stakeholder <strong>what success looks like</strong> and recorded their answer.

				<h3>I Was Asked to Lead, But Wasn't In Charge</h3>
				<p>Stakeholders were often skeptical, risk-averse, and viewed my ideas as threatening “the way it’s always been done.” And this is totally understandable. I learned frame my suggestions as solutions to their problems and <a href="http://muledesign.com/2014/09/13-ways-designers-screw-up-client-presentations">sell my designs</a>.</p>
				<h3>How My Company Works</h3>
				<p>I worked with every department and over 100 employees. I learned what everyone’s day-to-day looks like. Who speaks directly with customers. How clients are billed. What support issues keep coming up. And what parts of the website each department depends on most. Learning this was immensely helpful in prioritizing work that had the highest impact on the business.</p>
