	<p>I love email-design. Email marketing is one of the most effective ways of communication and will be for years to come. I believe it's worth investing in good email-design. I help companies, startups, and local business with email projects by creating email templates from scratch and helping fine-tune existing campaigns.</p>

	<h2>Ambit</h2>
	<p>I worked with Ambit to translate a few designs of their email-designs into responsive templates that looked native to the device they’re opened on. This involved removing a lot of CSS resets and embracing how emails display differently on different devices.</p>
