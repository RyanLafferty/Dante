						<p>Home Exchange originally approached me to audit and optimize a series of transactional emails in Mandrill. Since then, I’ve worked closely with the team to design a variety of email templates for Mailchimp, including a newsletter, discovery digest, case study, welcome letter, and reverse search template.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="uk-width-1-2">
						<p>As the designs were approved, I built each template in a hybrid manner (responsive without relying on media queries). With a solid baseline established for all major email clients, I used media queries and various email hacks to enhance each template further. Bulletproof buttons, hover effects, preview text, and an optimized images-off view, just to name few of the things. And everything works in from mobile Gmail to Desktop Outlook.</p>

						<p>Since 2011, I’ve been helping SeatGeek with email design. I started by designing a few digest and transactional email templates. My work evolved into creating a framework for almost all emails sent by the SeatGeek website, as well as a set of templates for one-off marketing and promotional emails. I’ve had my hand in nearly every email SeatGeek has sent since I started.</p>

						<p>As SeatGeek’s in-house email team has grown, my work focuses more on projects that require new or custom design work. Each time I embark on a new SeatGeek project, I know my email chops will be tested and I’ll likely learn something new!</p>

						<p>While contracting at Toys”R”Us, I became the point person in my group for HTML emails and created a best practices guide TRU’s email developers. One of my primary responsibilities was coding and deploying emails; my team shipped about 10-15 in a normal week.</p>
