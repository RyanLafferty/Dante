	<p>Since 2016, I’ve been a Sr. Product Designer at Stack Overflow, where I help create better workflows for over 50 million developers. Most of my work is focused on Stack Overflow for Teams, Stack Overflow Enterprise, and anything email related (more on that below). Most of Stack Overflow’s product and engineering teams, including myself, work remotely.</p>

	<p>Stack Overflow is default open with information, including how it pays its employees.</p>
	<p>We follow a double-diamond approach. From the early stages of each project, I work with product managers and engineers to create roadmaps, define scope, and write functional specs. From there I lead design exploration and prototyping, playing a lead role in design critiques, demos, and user research sessions. Once we narrow on a design direction, I help implement the designs in HTML / CSS (LESS) and work with the team to clarify any details or edge cases that come up along the way.</p>

	<p>Sample from a 5% fun exercise, where designers take 60 minutes and brainstorm on potential design with no boundaries.</p>
	<p>I spend about half of my day on communication. Attending meetings on Google Hangouts, being active in chat, creating Trello cards, commenting on GitHub issues, etc. Even though Stack Overflow’s designers work on different parts of product, we’re in constant communication, ensuring we’re designing consistently across the product.</p>
	<figure>[Email design transactional explorations]</figure>
	<p>When I joined Stack Overflow, we didn’t send much email aside from a few messages sent to active Q&A users and basic things like resetting a password. Email designs were inconsistent, templates were broken in many places, and outgoing emails were not tracked. I helped standardize our email design and rebuilt many of our templates so they display consistently across email clients. I also initiated Stack Overflow’s email design system that empowers non-email-designers to build well-designed, consistently-rendered email without knowing all the ins-and-outs of email design.</p>
	<figure>[Email Preferences]</figure>
	<p>As our email program evolved and we started to send better-targeted emails, I helped redesign our email preference center to keep pace. My coworker and I wrote about our design goals and published a UX case study for this project.</p>
