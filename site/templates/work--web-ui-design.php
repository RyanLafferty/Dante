						<p>Over several iterations, MasterStreet and I redesigned the site architecture and interaction design of interface. I reorganized profile listings into “cards” to maximize screen real estate and optimized tutor profile pages to be lead forms. I delivered a series of Photoshop comps and a responsive pattern library.</p>
