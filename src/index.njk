      <h1>I’m a reliable product designer and front-end developer working on websites, apps, 
HTML emails, and design systems.</h1>
      <p>I believe design is about taking the complex and chaotic and making it <strong class="highlight-yellow">accessible</strong> to people, <strong class="highlight-yellow">responsive</strong>, and as <strong class="highlight-yellow">fast</strong> as possible.</p>
      <p>My goal is to create work that’s cool enough to show <span class="tooltip">my friends</span> and honest enough to show <span class="tooltip">my parents</span>.</p>

            <p>I enjoy writing about things I learn, speaking occasionally, and maintaining Cerberus (OSS).
        When not in front of a screen I like to exercise, snowboard, both watch and play hockey and soccer, work on my house, and explore New Jersey with my wife and kids.</p>
