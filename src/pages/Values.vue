                <p>I'm a highly adaptable product designer. I prefer working as a generalist (going moderately deep in several areas) over specializing (going very deep in just one or two).</p>
                <p>I‚Äôm comfortable writing functional specs with product managers, jumping into code with engineers, and reviewing metrics with marketers. I can document every edge case in a design file, review pull requests in GitHub, lead research sessions, write UX copy, run meetings, and speak/present to large groups. I also value the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù part of my job: mentoring, hiring, improving design team processes, and contributing to the team culture.</p>

                <h2>What does ‚Äúgreat design‚Äù Look Like?</h2>
                <p>My primary job as a designer is to enable others to see the future. To see what could be. To help the team make better decisions faster.</p>
                <p>Conducting user research, producing wireframes and UX flows, and prototyping UIs are table stakes for any designer. A great designer‚Äôs job also includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>üì£ Facilitating:</strong> Help communicate everyone‚Äôs ideas by making them tangible, clarify goals, and check for understanding.</li>
                    <li><strong>üíé Stewardship:</strong> Protect and promote design, spread user perspective throughout the organization.</li>
                    <li><strong>üåü Connoisseurship:</strong> Show folks what good design is, elevate the team‚Äôs design taste, and hold the quality line.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>My colleague and I led a workshop on <a href="https://uxplanet.org/tips-for-leading-a-design-project-a638f5a71884">how designers lead design projects</a> at Stack Overflow.</p>
                <p>Here are a few lessons I‚Äôve learned over the years:</p>
                <div><g-image src="~/assets/img/illo-lightbulb.svg" alt=""/></div>
                <h2>Product Design</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Great design comes from learning to operate successfully inside an organization. No matter how skilled one is creating UIs + prototypes, if they can‚Äôt articulate their process and build healthy relationships, the work is unlikely to be accepted.</li>
                    <li>For designers to have a meaningful impact, they must go beyond beautification and understand the business needs to the same depth they understand their user‚Äôs needs.</li>
                    <li>Presentation and storytelling are important. Explain the scenario and sell the experience, from concept to final execution. Tell why, not just what. It helps others understand the design and feel more confident in it.</li>
                    <li>Good design makes people feel like they are in control. It explains what‚Äôs happening and what‚Äôs possible without making the user think.</li>
                    <li>Product designers don‚Äôt need to be expert coders, but some basic code knowledge goes a long way in shipping a high quality product.</li>
                    <li>Favor leveraging familiar trends and patterns. Rules can be bent or broken, but it should be an exception.</li>
                    <li>Good design doesn‚Äôt leave anyone behind. Progressive enhancement > Graceful degradation.</li>
                </ul>
                <div><g-image src="~/assets/img/illo-heart-convo.svg" alt=""/></div>
                <h2>Communication and Collaboration</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trust by default. Assume people are smart and good at what they do.</li>
                    <li>Invite others into your design process. The best work is created by diverse teams of designers and non-designers. Break the problem wide open at the beginning. I like starting design projects in a Google doc.</li>
                    <li>Listen to others and be open to their perspectives. They need that space and you need their perspectives.</li>
                    <li>When design is done in the open (where everyone can see and provide feedback), things that might get overlooked can be caught before a point of no return. It creates an environment of shared intelligence where everyone feels like part of the process. This is especially relevant to remote teams.</li>
                    <li>Communicate frequently and document decisions. This includes proactively pushing information out (email, chat, docs, etc.) and making it easy for others to pull information when they need it (searchable documentation, organized files, etc.).</li>
                </ul>
                <div><g-image src="~/assets/img/illo-hourglass.svg" alt=""/></div>
                <h2>Leadership</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Leadership is not management and it doesn‚Äôt require authority. It‚Äôs not a role, it‚Äôs how you work.</li>
                    <li>Lead by example. Be consistent and reliable.</li>
                    <li>When possible, lead others to conclusions they can make for themselves. Hold space for their learning process.</li>
                    <li>A mentor helps their mentee get to the next level with a balance of mentoring, coaching, and sponsoring. Ask how you can support your teammates, don‚Äôt just tell them they‚Äôre doing a good job and to keep doing their basic responsibilities.</li>
                    <li>Identify blockers and take responsibility in removing them.</li>
                    <li>Don‚Äôt assume why someone‚Äôs behaving the way they‚Äôre behaving, ask about what‚Äôs behind their actions and problem-solve together based on their answer.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Product Development Process</h2>
                <p>For the past few years, I‚Äôve worked in a double diamond process. Maybe you‚Äôre familiar with it:</p>
                <div><g-image src="~/assets/img/process.svg" alt="Double diamond product development process diagram"/></div>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Discover:</strong> Understand the current condition by auditing existing designs, reviewing competitors, interviewing users, ‚ÄúHow Might We‚Äù brainstorming sessions, and gathering insights.</li>
                    <li><strong>Define:</strong> Synthesize the ideas identified and focus on the most compelling opportunities. What has the most potential impact? Which should we do first? What‚Äôs feasible? What does success look like? The goal is to define exactly what we‚Äôll do and won't do.</li>
                    <li><strong>Develop:</strong> Explore the best potential solutions. Designs concepts are created, prototyped, tested, and iterated. This trial and error process helps ideas improve.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deliver:</strong> As confidence in the solution increases, exploration gives way to engineering. Working software is created, optimized, and shipped.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improve:</strong> Measure results and tweak when appropriate.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It fits our team well and I work in every phase. I especially like the parts where the problem is defined (every project needs goal and non-goals) and explored widely (considering a few wildly different ideas).</p>
                <figure>[pic about missing the right solution]</figure>
                <p>I‚Äôm not attached to this approach (or any other), but think it‚Äôs important that a process is defined. Having a product development process helps the org understand how design works and its responsibilities.</p>
