<!--[if lt IE 7 ]><div id="ie"><h4>What the Hell?</h4><p>You're using IE6 or worse. If this is how you browse the web, you're not getting the most out of websites these days. Honestly, I can't even begin to think about what your entire experience on the internet must be like... probably like riding a bicycle on the highway while cars blow by you at 70 MPH. So I'm sorry, but I've chosen not to support this site in your browser. If you used IE6 to research me and enquire about working with me, it's probably not going to work out. If you'd like to salvage something from this experience, please download <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> or <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com">Firefox</a> first. If you can't upgrade your old browser because you're at work or something, sorry, but that excuse no longer flies. Even <strong>Microsoft advises against using IE6</strong>.</p> <span>â˜¹</span></div><![endif]-->
